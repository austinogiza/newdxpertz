            <h1>PMP</h1>
            <p>Project Management Professional (PMP) is an internationally recognized professional designation offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI).
            </p>
            <p>The PMI’s standard for project management is contained in the Project Management Body of Knowledge, the PMBOK, whose first edition was released in 1996 and which has recently reached the 6th edition.</p>
            <p>Project managers work in a wide range of industries and fields. From IT to education, just about every industry benefits from hiring project managers.</p>
            <p>And every industry wants to hire the best of the best.</p>
            <p>When hiring new employees, companies look for someone who has the ability to lead and direct various projects and multiple members of a team.</p>
            <p>Working with project managers who are PMP certified tells companies that they have employees who have what it takes to complete projects on time and under budget.</p>

            <h1>WHY DO YOU NEED PMP CERTIFICATION?</h1>
            <p>Government, commercial and other organizations employ PMP certified project managers in an attempt to improve the success rate of projects in all areas of knowledge, by applying a standardized and evolving set of project management principles.</p>
            <p>To manage innovation in a structured way, project managers are highly requested in the work’s market, and even more so, the certified project managers.</p>
            <p>The work of a PMP is similar to most project managers. However, the difference that a PMP refers to a precise standard, talks their own language and is able to interpret reality and interact with it with a confidence that is given by both
                the experience and the PMBOK.</p>
            <p>The PMP certification has reached such a level of fame that it is often inserted as a preference or a pre-requisite in the job posts prepared by the employers worldwide.</p>
            <p>Also, the salary offered to a PMP is usually higher than the one offered to a non-certified project manager.
