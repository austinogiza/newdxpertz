            <h1>WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF IELTS EXAM?</h1>
            <p>We have two types of IELTS, Academic and General;
            </p>
            <h1>ACADEMIC IELTS:</h1>
            <p>The IELTS Academic test is for people applying for higher education or professional registration in an English speaking environment. <br> It reflects some of the features of academic language and assesses whether you are ready to begin studying
                or training. Unlike the general training version, the academic version allows test takers to demonstrate some reading and writing skills that aren’t necessarily part of the everyday communicative experience of English speakers. <br>These
                are considered to be distinct from reading and writing skills for general purposes</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
            <h1>GENERAL IELTS:</h1>
            <p>The IELTS General Training test is for those who are going to English speaking countries for secondary education, work experience or training programs. <br>It is also a requirement for migration to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK.
                <br> The test focuses on basic survival skills in broad social and workplace contexts.
            </p>
            <h1>WHAT IS IELTS SCORE BAND?</h1>
            <p>All IELTS scores are between 0 and 9. You can also get .5 scores as well (for example, 6.5 or 7.5). <br> You will get a band score for each skill (listening, reading, writing and speaking) and also an overview band score. <br>The overall band
                score is the average score of all the skills.</p>
